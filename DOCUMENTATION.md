# MovieMate - Project Documentation

## 1. Project Overview
MovieMate is a fullstack application that allows users to manage a list of movies they've watched or plan to watch. Users can add movies with details, filter & sort them, and delete movies from the list.

## 2. Architecture Diagram
Frontend (React.js) <--> Backend API (Flask) <--> Database (SQLite)

- React sends requests via Fetch API.
- Flask handles API routes (GET, POST, DELETE).
- SQLite stores movie records.

---

## 3. Data Flow
1. User submits movie details in the frontend.
2. Data is sent to Flask API via POST request.
3. Flask stores the data in SQLite DB.
4. Movies are fetched via GET request and displayed in React.
5. Filtering/Sorting is handled client-side.
6. Delete requests remove movies from DB & UI updates.
